# Olympic and Population Project

### Authors

### Purpose

Is there a relationship between the population size of a country and its success at Olympic games, in terms of medals earned?  

### Scope

In this project we will work with two data sources to prepare them for analysis. 
One with data on Olympic athletes, their country, sport, and medals earned. A second data set with country populations.
We will import, clean, and prepare these data sources in preparation for future analysis, and provide initial EDA (exploratory data analysis) on the data.
