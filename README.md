# Olympic and Climate Project

### Authors

### Purpose

Is there a relationship between the climate of a country and its participation at Summer and Winter Olympic games and their success in terms of medals earned? How have cold weather climate countries participation in Summer games and warm weather countries participation in Winter games changed over time? Does a country's climate impact its success at each seasons' games?

### Scope

In this project we will work with two data sources to prepare them for analysis. 
One with data on Olympic athletes, their country, sport, and medals earned. A second data set with country temperatures.
We will import, clean, and prepare these data sources in preparation for future analysis, and provide initial EDA (exploratory data analysis) on the data.
